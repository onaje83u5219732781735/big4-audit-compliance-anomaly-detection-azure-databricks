# Contributing

This is a **docs‑only, sanitised case study**. Contributions are welcome in the form of:

- Fixes to documentation, diagrams, and terminology.
- Additional examples of patterns for Streaming Pipelines, Batch Pipelines, ETL/ELT, and ML governance.
- Improvements to runbooks, SLO descriptions, and DQ rule definitions.

## Guidelines

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch.
2. Make your changes in Markdown / JSON files.
3. Run markdown linting if you have `pre-commit` installed.
4. Submit a pull request with a clear description of the changes.

In real client work, ensure that **no confidential or client‑identifiable information** is ever committed to a public repository.
